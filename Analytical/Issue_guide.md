## Issue Essey

### Organization of Issue Essay

__Introduction__
- Hook (generalization, anecdote, interesting fact, trend, quote, etc.)
    - Introduces the topic (nothing more); don't write your thesis or supporting ideas!
- Shift to prompt
    - Makes your essay more cohesive; an abrupt shift to your thesis is awkward
- Thesis (most important part of the essay, by far)
    - This baby is the boss that controls everything
- Outline (Tell your reader how you're going to structure your essay)
    - Doesn't have to be overly detailed

__Body Paragraph__
- Topic sentence that introduces supporting idea
    - It is imperative that this introduce the overall idea of the paragraph and that it supports your thesis.
- Example
    - You need a good example here, preferably from history, politics, economics, etc. If not possible, think of a good hypothetical. I don't want to hear about Uncle Bob.
- Development/Explanation
    - You need to develop this idea. You need to explain how your supporting idea

__Conclusion__
- (strong thesis) Introduce a counterpoint that someone from the other side might use to argue against your position
- shut down that counterpoint and explain how it doesn't apply and doesn't hold water
- Rephrase thesis and wrap this baby up
&nbsp;
- (moderate thesis) Explain how this issue is very complex and that there are no easy answers.
- Rephrase thesis and wrap this baby up


### Ideas
