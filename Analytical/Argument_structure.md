# Argument structure
__Introduction__
1. Rephrase main conclusion from argument
2. Identify author's evidence and/or premises
3. Thesis (to actually follow the specific task instructions)

__Body paragraph (three of them)__
1. First supporting idea (making sure to follow specific task instructions)
2. Example 1 (making sure to use 'maybe' language)
3. Example 2 (making sure to use 'maybe' language)
4. Effect on author's conclusion if examples prove true

__Conclusion__
1. Statement that argument, as it stands now, is flawed
2. Request for more evidence
3. Statement of how evidence will help evaluate the argument more effectively

# Example
_Rephrase conclusion:__ In the editorial from the local newspaper, it is stated that opponents of the motorists' lobby's plan to add another lane to Blue Highway have instead advocated that a bicycle lane be constructed in order to alleviate the highway's traffic issues.
_Premises_: The opponents have come to this conclusion based on the issues faced by Green Highway last year as well as the keen interest in bicycling of the area's local residents. 
__However, before this recommendation can be properly evaluated, three questions must be answered.__

_Crtitsize premise1:_ First of all, are Green Highway and Blue Highway roughly comparable? In other words, can circumstances from one highway be used to make generalizations and predictions about the other? It is possible that Green Highway and Blue Highway are not similar at all - perhaps Green Highway runs through residential neighborhoods, whereas Blue Highway is located mostly in rural, unpopulated sections of the city. Further, there is a possibility that the quality of the highways is markedly different, with Green Highway's roads falling apart and Blue Highway's in pristine condition. If either of these scenarios has merit, then conclusion drawn in the original argument is significantly weakened.

_Crtitsize premise2:_ Secondly, do a majority of the area residents interested in biking live within biking distance of their places of employment? The opponents in the argument prematurely assume that many of the residents in the town will bike to work in the morning rather than drive their cars. However, this might not be the case. Perhaps the average distance from home to work is over 15 miles, and that's why many of the residents are essentially obligated to take the highway - even if they don't want to. In an ideal world, they might choose to bike to work, but if the reality is such that they cannot do so due to the logistics of their situations, then only one form of transportation (the car via the highway) is possible. If the above is true, then the argument does not hold water.

_Crtitsize premise3:_

_Now argument is flawed:_ In conclusion, the argument, as it stands now, is considerably flawed due to its reliance on several unwarranted assumptions. 
_Request more evidence, then..:_ If the author is able to answer the three questions above and offer more evidence (perhaps in the form of a systematic research study), then it will be possible to fully evaluate the viability of the proposed recommendation to add a bike lane to Blue Highway.
