The best way for a society to prepare its young people for leadership in government, industry, or other fields is by instilling in them a sense of cooperation, not competition.

partially agree
for:
- cooperation is a winning survival strategy according to the evolution
- most of modern state of the art technologies have been made possible exclusively due to high level of cooperation among individuals, companies, countries, continents 
- too high level of cooperation can lead to monopolism


The question of how to prepare a new generation for successful life in the future is far from being trivial. The prompt claims that it is beneficial to nurture cooperation in young people instead of competition. Personally, I partially agree with the above statement for three reasons.

Firstly, it is a proved fact that cooperation is one of the best winning survival strategies. Humanity has been successfully utilising this approach since the very birth of our kind and there is evidence why. Diverse people posses a highly varying sets of their strengths and weaknesses. As a result, for a group of human beings it is most optimal to use their strong traits to their full potential, while trying to mitigate or eliminate the weak ones completely. One effective way of doing so is assigning role to specific members of society in accordance with their capabilities or fields of competence. For example, in primal times people divide themselves into those who hunt, gather and nurture their offspring. Thus, such a group of humans with diversified occupations is much more likely to survive comparing to an individual.

Secondly, most of modern state of the art technologies became possible in the first place due to an incredible level of cooperation. For instance, we take for granted such technology as laptops and smartphones often without realisation how much effort was put into their development and implementation. A whole scientific community combined their effort to come up with theoretical evidence, conducted experiments and published their knowledge. Then companies begin to industrialise acquired knowledge to actually produce components, which later can be assembled into the final product. To sum it up, people need their combined effort to gather knowledge, natural resources, manufacturing facilities to release a fully functional piece of cutting-edge technology.

However, one should be aware that extremely developed level of cooperation may later lead to a creation of monopoly. Lack of competition in any field of human life can easily yield devastating results. For instance, In Russia most scarce natural resources such natural gas and oil are solely controlled by the government. One may argue that this is a reliable way to protect aforementioned resources, yet in practice a monopoly was created whose primary interest is to control the power. Acquired money are spent on ideological films, all sorts of propaganda or simply stolen as a 'personal wealth' instead of being invested in the further development of highly profitable business.

All in all, I think it is absolutely vital to strike the balance between promotion of cooperation and competition among young people. Basically one can not exist without the other, which makes it a complex idea to be implemented in the real world.
