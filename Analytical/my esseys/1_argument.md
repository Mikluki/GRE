children are reared by an entire village is wrong 

conclusion: observation centered approach is less accurate than interview based approach 
based on 
    + interview with the group of the children from the group of islands, which includes Tertia
    + more time talking about their biological parents
    

In his article Dr. Karp comes to a conclusion that observation centered approach is less accurate than interview based one after comparing his experiment to that of Dr. Field. Dr. Karp suggests that children of Tertia spend more time with their own parents, because in his interview children talked more about their biological parents rather than other adults. However, before this argument can be properly evaluated some evidence should be explained in more detail.

Firstly, in his research Dr. Karp and his team of graduate students conducted the interviews with children from a group of islands including Tertia. If Dr. Karp has drawn his conclusion based on conversations with children from diverse islands, it is safe to assume that he finds the social structure of aforementioned islands to be comparable. In other words he believes that children from all islands in his research group are brought up similarly, at the same conditions. So far this assumption is lacking the evidence, which weakens Dr. Karp's conclusion significantly.

Secondly, does talking more about an adult means that a child spends more time with them or it rather means that a child has a higher level of attachment to them? For example, during earlier years of life children usually tend to spend most of their time in kindergarten or school, yet there is no clear evidence that in the casual conversation they will bring up their classmates more often than their parents. After all, parents are likely to play a more significant role in lives of their offspring rather than peers or teachers. If the above is true than the argument does not hold water. 

Finally, the fact that a child spends more time with a person does not necessarily means that this person is responsible for their parenting. Once again it can be explained by child's strong connection to that specific person. And the question of how this connection was formed is yet to be answered. For example, it can occur due to some enjoyable quality time together, well-established routine that has deep meaning or simply due to some random event that temporarily caused a child to pay more attention to this specific adult.

In conclusion, the argument as it stands now, is considerably flawed due to its reliance on several unwarranted assumptions. If the author is able to shed the light on the evidence discussed above and offer more factual support, then it will be fully possible to evaluate the viability of the proposed interview approach.
