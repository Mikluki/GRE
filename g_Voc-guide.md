# Math
Where would I divide into 2 distinct thoughts?
The goal of text completion is not to read it. I'm looking into where the sentence is divided.
__Looking for divisions__


- X  ___;___ Y      ->  X,Y {support each other}
- X __:__ Y         ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X __,__ Y         ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X __.__ Y         ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _and_ Y         ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _not only but also_ Y ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _furthermore_ Y ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _moreover_ Y    ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _in addition_ Y ->  X,Y {support each other} 
- X _that_ Y        ->  X,Y {usually support } 

- Although          -> {contrast} (-)
- Even X __,__ (-)X -> {contrast}
- However           -> {contrast} (-)
- Yet               -> {contrast} (-)
- X _remarkable_ Y  -> {surprise/ usually contrast} (-)

_remarkable_ is one of the contrast words {they change the sense completely}

# Simplifying
> Imagine you are talking to Michel Skot, lovable idiot
### Small passage
- Whenever you read, take _simple notes_. It will keep you __busy__. You __wont drift off__

### Big passage
- In big passages you _cant go by every sentence_; you have to __simplify by sentences__
- Do _not fucking care_ about _repeated info_

Common strust:
    - fact
    - examp
    - elaboration
- __How to see the main idea__ :
    + you will contrasts -> __Hammer__
    + or many examples that supports thesis


## Timing
__move with purpose__, do not sit with the poop bag
_clock stops while skipping_
- let the __3 blanker go__
1. SE - sentence equivalence
2. TC - text completion
3. RC - reading comprehension
    - 3 blankers are against probability
__BE PURPOSEFUL__
